A plain sponge cake doesn’t look like much until it’s jazzed up with frosting and toppings.
In the same way, fashion accessories give flavor to an ordinary looking outfit.</pre>

Accessories are often considered investments by most women and men because these pieces 
add personality to an outfit and offer so many more opportunities to showcase 
an individual sense of style. They may be small items, but they have the power to 
complete one'slook while exuding their taste, style, and preferences. 
If you are still wondering why accessories are so well-loved by so many, here’s our case for
 accessorizing more:</p></pre>
<pre><h2>Accessories help style outfits differently</h2><hr align="center" size=5 width=1500 color="lavender">
If you have a collection of accessories, you do not have to buy that many different clothes.
 A repeated outfit is not a problem with the right accessories. Dress a basic outfit up with a statement necklace
  and a beautiful pair of earrings.Dress the same outfit down with a few subtle stacked bracelets
   and a reliable pair of studs.With just a few accessory changes, you can get several style combinations! 
Accessories and clothes are the best partners.Each serves the best for one another by enhancing the way the other looks.</pre>
<pre><h2>Shows up your personality</h2><hr align="center" size=5 width=1500 color="lavender">
Two people wearing the same outfit but accessorizing them differently is a classicexample of how
 accessories play an important role in expressing individuality.No style looks exactly the same, 
 so if you want to flaunt your personality more, purchase accessories that speak your style.These 
small items can help amplify your character in ways you never thought they could.</pre>
<pre><h2>Saves more shopping time</h2><hr align="center" size=5 width=1500 color="lavender">
Shopping for accessories is relatively easier and faster than buying pieces of clothing.
When purchasing accessories, you only need to consider a few things:how its color matches your
skin, if the size is right for you, and how it enhances your outfit.
Shopping for clothes will involve a lot of testing, rummaging through cloth racks,and coming to
different stores.If you need an outfit for an event, instead of finding a new one,why not try to make 
a new look out of your existing clothes through a different selection of fashion accessories? 
Don’t be surprised when you spend much less than you thought you would!</pre>
<pre><h2> Wearing accessories is a fun activity</h2><hr align="center" size=5 width=1500 color="lavender">
If you love being creative, you will likely enjoy putting together different combinations of the
 pieces from your accessory collection to suit different occasions.Finding the right style that the occasion 
needs is always an exciting adventure that will give you a chance to experiment!
It is a challenge, yet it is a fun one. Nothing also beats the thrill you will get once you find the perfect combination.</pre>
<pre><h2>It is a conversation starter</h2><hr align="center" size=5 width=1500 color="lavender">
It isn’t uncommon to be greeted with comments of “You look great!”or “Did you lose weight?”
 when you’re striking up a conversation, especially at parties or events.Accessories are great conversation starters. Instead of commenting on an individual's physique—which often can be taken the wrong way—why 
 not start a conversation about your favorite pair of earrings instead? 

Complimenting people on the look they worked so hard on is always an excellent way
to start an exchange without drawing attention to physical traits they may not have as much control over.
<p>Fashion accessories are beautiful items that can change the look of any clothes and style.
It can improve one's appearance and make one feel better about themselves.It is a good investment piece that comes in many forms.If you want to jazz up your look, stop paying attention to clothes and clothes alone—accessories are a great way to showcase your sense of style for practically any occasion!</p>
